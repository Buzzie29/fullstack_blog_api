📰 TechnoVerse | Full-Stack MERN Blog Project 🚀
TechnoVerse is a complete full-stack blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
Developed as a minor full-stack project, it demonstrates secure authentication, clean REST APIs, and a responsive, modern frontend built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
Users can register, log in, and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their own posts — all within a smooth and minimal user interface.
