# 📰 TechnoVerse | Full-Stack MERN Blog Project 🚀
**TechnoVerse** is a complete full-stack blog application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
Developed as a **minor full-stack project**, it demonstrates secure authentication, clean REST APIs, and a responsive, modern frontend built with **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Users can **register**, **log in**, and perform **full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on their own posts — all within a smooth and minimal user interface.
